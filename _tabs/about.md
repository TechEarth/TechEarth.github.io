## Who am I?
Hello, my name is Naufal Shidqi. I'm a technology and AI enthusiast currently studying for a Master’s Degree in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) and a student research assistant at the [Data Science Group of the Institute for Basic Science (IBS)](https://ds.ibs.re.kr/) advised by [Prof. Meeyoung Cha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iFlnVCoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I have experience in projects related to VLSI, IC design, embedded systems, and the Android OS platforms. I am passionate about the research area of applied AI/Machine Learning (ML), edge-device/mobile computing, and computer vision, as well as discovering useful patterns and knowledge extracted from data.

Prior to KAIST, I was a Development Team Lead and an Embedded System Engineer at [TSM Technologies](https://www.tsmid.com/) working on IoT & Android OS software platforms for industrial applications. I also worked as an IC Design Engineer at [Marvell Technology](https://www.marvell.com/). I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering from [Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB)](https://www.itb.ac.id/) in 2015, under the supervision of [Dr. Widyawardana Adiprawita](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u4h4HYgAAAAJ&hl=en).
